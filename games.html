<h5>The World of Ezeret</h5>
<p>This is one of my dream games. It's called "The World of Ezeret". 
  It's an RPG where you choose between four characters (Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher). 
  The power of all characters is to take the finder's skills. 
  The first thing you choose between Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher is only the dispatch, a Magus can also use mele skills and a Poacher can also use heal. 
  So it's only the dispatch of your character you choose here. A character doesn't get any skills from leveling up, they just get better stats. 
  You get skills from the enemy and you have to choose carefully because you can only take one of the enemy's skills.
  Here's an example, we have a Skeleton soldier, Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter and a Skeleton priest as enemies. 
  You can only choose one of these finder's skills. So if you choose a skill from the Skeleton soldier, you can't choose from the Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter or Skeleton priest. 
  You can also only choose one of the Skeleton soldier's skills. Once you have taken a skill from the Skeleton monsters you have to wait until you meet the next 
  type of enemy but they will have completely different skills from the Skeleton. 
  So this is a game that challenges your way of thinking. What kind of character do I have? What play style do I want?

<h5>Pitborn</h5>
      <p>This is my second dream game, it's an RPG/Survival game and it's name is Pitborn. You get to choose between 3 monsters. The monsters are Skeleton, Goblin or Undead.
        There is also a fourth choice but it will be a surprise. The game is about you being a monster that is born in a dungeon.
        You are the weakest monster in the dungeon. So you have to survive, you have to collect materials and build a shelter from other monsters and people.
        You have to create weapons and equipment so that you can defeat the monsters that are stronger. When you defeat monsters that are stronger, you level up and become stronger yourself.
        The goal of the game is to become so strong that you can defeat the dungeon master and become the dungeon master yourself. 
        After you become the dungeon master, you have to collect materials and monsters to develop the dungeon.
        You have to develop the dungeon so that it becomes more difficult for people but also other monsters you do not control to reach you.</p>
