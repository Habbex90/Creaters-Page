Habbex Creator Page!

Welcome to my creator page, or you can call it a portfolio!
Here I collect my games, music, paintings, novels and poems – all built to both inspire and show my knowledge of frontend development.

Live Demo

What will you find here?
- Games: Interactive projects built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Each game has an introduction page with animations and a separate page for the game itself.
- Music: A page with my songs and a custom audio player.
- Paintings: A responsive gallery where you can see my artwork.
- Novels & poems: Texts presented in a reader-friendly interface with search function.
- Other: Experiments and other creative projects.

Techniques I use
- HTML5 → semantic structure
- CSS3 → Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design
- JavaScript (ES6) → interactivity, logic for games and animations
- Modular code structure → each section has its own files for easy overview
- Best practices → accessibility (a11y), performance optimization and lazy loading
